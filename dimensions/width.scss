// we have a grid of 12 columns
// we have 3 breakpoints: phone, tablet, desktop
// desktop and above supports 12 columns
// [tablet, desktop[ supports 8 columns
// [phone, tablet[ supports 4 columns
// [.., phone[ supports 2 columns
// each element can be assigned a number of columns it wants

// an additional problem is the column gap which we don't have under control
// even we for instance want to have two columns, each at 50% in a row
// that's fine, until the row adds a column gap of even 1px
// this will cause the second 50% column to wrap to the next line (assuming wrap is on)
// without wrapping, there is less use from a responsive point of view

// even if we knew the column gap size, we wouldn't know how many cells are in a particular row
// one approach (used here) is instead of setting the "width" to 50%
// we set the min width to slightly above the next level and the max to the actual size
// we then set flex-grow to 1 with no basis
// this means we can predictably state that it will fill the size we wanted

// I tested in firefox and chrome (@27-05-2022) and both gave the correct result EXCEPT in a particular case
// suppose we have two column-6 on a desktop (so we want 50% each)
// we want a column and row gap of 16pixels.
// we want to set wrapping on the row so it can cleanly resize for responsive
// as mentioned above, if we set hard 50%, it will overflow to the next
// if we set the below rules, we consistently had equal division of space EXCEPT when one of the cells had a _different_ horizontal padding from the other
// if both have the same horizontal padding (vertical doesn't matter) it works (whether that is no padding at all or a particular padding)
// once they have different padding, the column gap is deducted more from the side with the least padding
// no padding (or the same padding) resulted in both sides being exactly 902.5px
// once we bring a difference in padding, for example we set a padding-right of 1pixel on the left one, we get 903px width left and 902px right 
// if we set padding-left of 10pixels on the left one, it is 907.5px and the right one is 897.5px
// this means the following grid approach should be pixel perfect if we keep track of the padding on the columns themselves

// note that this is NOT pixel perfect across wrapped rows unless they are fully padded
// so if (through wrapping) you have 3 items (set at width 4) on one row and the last one on the next line
// this last one will be slightly wider because there is no column gap to compensate for
// the only way to ensure this doesn't happen is to make sure you always have "full" rows using empty content as needed
// in other words: the sum of all your configured columns _must_ be a multiple of 12

// TODO: but... on tablets it must be a multiple of 8 and on phones of 4... this makes it hard, should perhaps reduce tablet to 6?
// or put phones at 2 and tablets at 6?
// anything below phone is than 1 max

// width 12 is always 100%, regardless of screen size
